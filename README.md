## About

Sets is an application that allows you to play the classic puzzle game Set! You can play singleplayer or multiplayer. You can join a game with a link shared by a friend or you can enter the room code into the join form. If you register you can be part of the site ranking and compare your scores to other users. You will also have access to a dashboard which will contain your match history so you can track your progress.

## Multiplayer Server
This project owes much to the [Colyseus Framework](https://colyseus.io). The management of the game state, and player timing was handled using this library.

## Roadmap
* Currently in development is a charitable donation payment portal, using Stripe API. 
* Registered users will soon be able to see their game history.
* Want to add varying levels of difficulty when playing the computer.
* Would also like to add more card skins to the game. If you would like to make skins and submit them then credit will be given to you for teh skins and if possible down the road we will set up a portal for users to pay for the skins.
